  Happy Birthday Baby! 🎉🎂🎈 First of all "Thank You so much for coming in my life and making it so much more special. Your presence is a gift I cherish every day.
  You are an incredible person with a heart of gold, and I feel so lucky to have you by my side. Your kindness, compassion, and unwavering support mean the world to me. 
  We met through a journey and I had no idea you will be a part of my life forever. From the moment we met, I knew there was something special about you. Your smile, your laughter, and your infectious energy drew me in, and I felt an instant connection.
  I fell in love with your beutiful, pure soul, kind heart, and your amazing personality. I was not looking for love but you came into my life and made it so much more beautiful.
  Your love has transformed me in ways I never thought possible. You have shown me what it means to truly care for someone, to be selfless, and to love unconditionally.
  You gave me a reason to believe in love again. You gave me respect, care and love. You made me feel special and important in every possible way.
  I never thought someone will love me the way you do without asking anything in return. You are my best friend, my confidant, and my soulmate. I cannot imagine my life without you in it.
  I love you Miss Kriti Singh, I love you for who you are, and I love you for the person you make me want to be. You inspire me to be a better person every day, and I am so grateful for your presence in my life.
  I promise to always cherish and love you, to support you in all your dreams and aspirations, and to be there for you through thick and thin.
  I know I'm not perfect, but I promise to always strive to be the best partner I can be for you. I will always be honest, faithful, and loyal to you, and I will never take your love for granted.
  Thanks for choosing me and loving me. I will always be there for you, no matter what. You are my everything, and I cannot wait to spend the rest of my life making you happy.
  Happy Birthday once again, my love. May this year be filled with joy, laughter, and all the things that make you happy. You deserve nothing but the best, and I will always do my best to give you just that.
  With all my love,
  Rishav`,
