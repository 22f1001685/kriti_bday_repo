  content: `Hello Aloo Bhujiya

  Sorry I am not good in expressing my feelings, but I want you to know that I am really very lucky to have you as my friend. Not Everyone is fortunate enough to have a friend like you. All those chaos, fun talks, and the way you understand me is just priceless.
 
  I wish to make you smile everyday, whenever you find yourself in the chaos of your mind, I will try to make your way clear to a peaceful mind.
  
  Thank you for existing, Aloo Bhujiya.

  I just want to say that You truly are very special to me. You often ask me about your looks, behaviour and I always not be able to give you a proper answer, but today from my heart i just want to say that You are really beautiful. Either by Looks or by Nature, I have never seen a girl like you. Truth is no words can ever be able to describe how much you mean to me.
  You wanna know why it's you? So today I will tell you.. 

  The girl I dreamed of, the one I hoped to call mine someday. I imagined her smile, the way she'd speak, the warmth in her heart, the way we fights, the way she behaves and all the little things that would make her special to me. And then you came into my life… and every single detail I had ever dreamed of, every quality I had ever wished for, I see it all in you. It's like you were crafted from my imagination, but even more beautiful, more perfect than I could’ve ever dreamed.
  The way you become a child in front of me... I don't know whether it's just me or you behave like that in front of everyone but you childish behavoiur makes me feel thatyes this is what i always dreamed of as my wife.
  I have learned a lot of things from you and i want to learn more.. I want to be with you in every situation where you find yourself stuck.
  But things not always these cheesy, so we do argue and fights but the way you fix and talks about it is the point where i am determined that this is it. This is all i want. This is the exact girl i have ever dreamed of.. Life never gives you a second chance to have the person who is exactly like your dream person and now i know that it's you, so i don't want you to just go.
  So I love the way you carry yourself, how your eyes light up when you smile, how your presence changes everything around you. You don’t just look beautiful—you are beautiful, in every way that matters and in every way that steals my heart a little more every day. This can't be helpful for me.. Coz it's like an ocean and i am drwoning day by day.
  
  From the very first moment I started feeling something for you, everything changed. Every song I hear, every romantic movie I watch—it all feels like it's about you. Like it’s telling our story. I find myself lost in the lyrics, seeing your face in every line, imagining us in every scene.  I know it's too filmy but it is what it is... I even sometimes imagine you beside me and i keep blushing too..
  I know I am not perfect, I make a lot of mistakes and i don't even knowhow to explain myself but with you i don't have to do anything. You always understands me that's your real beauty and that makes you even more beautiful from everyone else around you. I feel more mature, more grownup and sometimes jsut a kid in front of you. 
  
  I see my mom in you. The way you take care of every small things about me reminds me how my mom used to take care of me. So also one of the reason that i want to just give you all the princess treatment you deserve.
  You take care of me like me mom, you scolds me like a friend, you show me the right path like a teacher, You understands me like a guardian. Even sometimes i feel like i am younger than you and you are the elder one.
  
  I don't know what future holds but whatever time i have with you, I just want to make everything special foryou. I want to take care of you, Create newmemories, go on trips and have fun together. So that I can always cherish you even when you will be gone.
  I wish i can hold you forever but I know that life is not always in our control. So I will cherish every moment with you and make the most of our time together. And before scolding me with we are just friends talk, i am saying all these things to you as a friend.

  So let's make the most of our time together and create beautiful memories that we can cherish forever. 

  I wish you all the good luck, best wishes to you and anything which comes in between you and your happiness then I will divert them to the other side.
  Happy Birthday Megha

  Your Akarshieee
